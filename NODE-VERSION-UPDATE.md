# Node.js Version Update

## What Changed

This project has been updated to use Node.js v23.11.0 or higher:

1. Changed `.tool-versions` to specify Node.js v23.11.0
2. Updated `package.json` "engines" field to accept Node.js v23.11.0 or higher (`"node": ">=23.11.0"`)
3. Updated README.md to reflect the new Node.js version requirements

## Why This Change Was Made

Previously, the project required Node.js v20.19.1, which was causing compatibility warnings when using the current Node.js v23.11.0 installation. Instead of downgrading Node.js, we've updated the project configuration to support the newer version.

## What This Means For You

- You can now use your current Node.js v23.11.0 installation without compatibility warnings
- The previously created documents (`nodejs-version-resolution.md`, `daisyui-setup-verification.md`, and `action-plan.md`) are now obsolete and can be ignored or removed
- No need to switch Node.js versions or use asdf for version management specifically for this project

## Next Steps

1. If you had installed packages before this change, you may want to reinstall them to ensure they're properly built for your Node.js version:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

2. Continue with your development work using daisyUI and Tailwind CSS with your current Node.js installation

## VSCode daisyUI Integration

The VSCode setup for daisyUI remains unchanged and should work correctly with the updated Node.js version:

- GitHub Copilot is configured to use daisyUI documentation via `.vscode/daisyui.md`
- Context7 MCP server is set up for enhanced AI support

## Note About asdf

While this project no longer strictly requires asdf for version management (since we're now using your current Node.js version), the asdf setup remains in place and can still be useful for other projects.
